# pub-aie7-rag-fastapi-react

This is an end-to-end RAG application that allows users to upload PDFs for addition to the knowlegebase.

## Homework 3 Assignment

[here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE7/blob/main/03_End-to-End_RAG/README.md)

Verify that Activity #1 was completed by validating that:
    Cursor/Claude followed the global rules you added to the .cursor file:
        It created a new branch prior to generating code
        It created a MERGE.md file with appropriate instructions for merging this new branch

        NOTE: If you "used your own mind" rather than vibe coding with Cursor/Claude then it is your responsibility to do these two things, or ask Claude directly to do them for you.

    The deployed application is able to upload a PDF, index it, and then chat about the contents of the PDF.

Verify that Activity #2 was completed by validating that:
    Cursor/Claude followed the global rules you added to the .cursor file (samme as in Step 1 above)
    The deployed application is still able to upload, process, and chat about a PDF (the functionality of Activity #1)
    The deployed application meets your new functionality requirements for the RAG-specific use-case that you implemented
